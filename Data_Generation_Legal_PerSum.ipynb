This adherence to the provisions of the Wealth Tax Act and the strict interpretation of 'net wealth' strengthens the prosecution's reliance on statutory law. Evidently, the Court has given weightage to the accrued interest on the assessee's money lending investments as important evidence. This could potentially influence similar future cases where assets are not confined to cash. The judge's reasoning aligns with and bolsters the prosecution's arguments, as it endorses consistent statutory interpretation and doesn't allow the choice of accounting system to circumvent the provisions of the Wealth Tax Act. The judgment confirms the importance of valuing all economic activities and liabilities on the valuation date, irrespective of whether they have been realized in cash or not, offering potential advantages in exposing hidden or unrealised assets.\",\n","      \"defense\": \"From the defense attorney's point of view, this judgment raises crucial legal questions about the applicability of the Wealth Tax Act when the assessee maintains accounts on a cash basis. While no direct legal precedent seems to be in favor of the defendant, the contradictions between the rulings of different High Courts indicate room for contesting the legal interpretation. This judgment does not significantly question the admissibility of the prosecution's evidence but underlines the different High Court stances which might be used to challenge the interpretation of the key evidence - the accrued interest. The judge's reasoning acknowledges the apparent contradictions between high court rulings and in doing so, recognizes the need for a uniform interpretational approach. Thus, the defense could argue for an appeal based on the divergent opinions of different High Courts and the need for a more nuanced interpretation of the statute considering the variability and specifics of accounting systems.\"\n","    }}\n","    \"\"\".format(judgement_text)\n","\n","    return get_response(system_prompt, user_prompt)\n","\n","\n","def generate_and_save(args):\n","    index, judgement, filepath = args\n","    try:\n","        new_text = generate(judgement)\n","        # Save the result immediately\n","        with lock:\n","            df = pd.read_csv(filepath)\n","            df.at[index, 'GeneratedText'] = new_text\n","            df.to_csv(filepath, index=False)\n","        return (index, new_text)\n","    except Exception as e:\n","        return (index, None)\n","\n","\n","def generate_and_save_parallelly(filepath):\n","\n","    try:\n","        # Loading the CSV into a DataFrame\n","        df = pd.read_csv(filepath)\n","\n","        if 'Target_Column' not in df.columns:\n","            df['Target_Column'] = None\n","\n","        to_generate = [(index, row['Text'], filepath) for index, row in df.iterrows() if pd.isnull(row['Target_Column']) or row['Target_Column'] == \"\"]\n","\n","        with multiprocessing.Pool(processes=multiprocessing.cpu_count()) as pool:\n","            list(tqdm(pool.imap(generate_and_save, to_generate), total=len(to_generate), desc=\"Generating text\"))\n","\n","        # Checking if all rows have been generated\n","        df = pd.read_csv(filepath)\n","        if df['Target_Column'].isnull().sum() == 0:\n","            print(\"All rows have been generated.\")\n","\n","    except KeyboardInterrupt:\n","        print(\"Process interrupted by user.
