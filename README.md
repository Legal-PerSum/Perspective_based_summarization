# Perspective_based_summarization

## Abstract
Legal text summarization, specifically perspective-based summarization is a growing interest in Legal Natural Language Processing (Legal-NLP), for solicitors or readers who needs to focus on comprehending lengthy legal documents from varied perspectives. Recognizing the absence of perspective-based datasets in the legal domain, this work pioneers the generation of a semi-synthetic dataset, Legal Perspective Summarization (Legal-PerSum) utilizing existing legal documents and the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). This dataset serves as a cornerstone for developing models that not only condenses legal texts but also aligns them with specific user perspectives (the prosecution and defense attorneys) as opposed to only a generic viewpoint, making them more accessible and comprehensible for a diverse audience. We systematically analyze the quality of Legal-PerSum using human evaluation and natural language inference based metrics. Next, we benchmark Legal-PerSum on several general-purpose LLMs using fine-tuning and strictly zero-shot prompting due to the context length of the judgement cases. The efficacy of these techniques is gauged through several automated and human evaluation. The findings underscore that adapting large language models (LLMs) to domain-specific legal tasks markedly enhances their performance in summarizing legal judgement cases from different perspectives. By tackling the inherent challenges associated with perspective-based summarization and emphasizing the critical role of interpretability, this research makes a significant contribution to advancing foundational methodologies for improving perspective-based summarization in the legal domain
