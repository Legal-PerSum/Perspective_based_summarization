This reinforces the legal principle that statutory obligations cannot be avoided based on the method of accounting, thereby strengthening the prosecution’s argument. The court's acceptance of accrued interest as valid evidence adds substantial weight to financial records reflecting potential but unrealized income. Judicial reasoning favored a strict interpretation of ‘net wealth,’ aligning with the initiator’s case, and emphasized the relevance of economic value on the valuation date over actual receipt. This decision enhances the initiator’s ability to pursue hidden or deferred assets under tax obligations.\", \n",
    "  \"respondent\": \"From the respondent’s perspective, the judgment acknowledges conflicting interpretations across different High Courts, which opens avenues for challenging the Supreme Court’s stance. Although the judgment does not dismiss the evidence submitted by the initiator, it implicitly raises the issue of how accounting systems influence tax liabilities. The respondent can leverage the observed judicial acknowledgment of legal ambiguities as a basis for appeal. The defense may argue that applying the Wealth Tax Act without considering the assessee’s cash-based accounting could be unfair and lacking nuance. This case thus serves as a potential basis for arguing for harmonization of judicial interpretations in future disputes involving accrual versus cash accounting principles.\"\n",
